# CP1404 Prac 10 - Reflection

## Estimates

When time estimates were first introduced (Prac 5) my estimates quite accurate, usually being less than 5 minutes off.
Prac 6 was similar, although there was one estimate I was 7 minutes off for. However, my estimate of 60 minutes for the
Project Management exercise in Prac 7 was completely wrong, as it took me almost 3 hours. After this, I over-estimated
how long the Prac 8 tasks would take, leading to the estimates being almost double the actual time it took. For Prac 9
though, my estimate for the Taxi Simulator exercise was pretty spot on. Overall, I don't think my accuracy really
improved over the full subject period, but it definitely improved from Pracs 7-8 to 9.
