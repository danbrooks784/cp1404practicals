# CP1404 Prac 10 - Reflection

## Estimates

When time estimates were first introduced (Prac 5) my estimates quite accurate, usually being less than 5 minutes off.
Prac 6 was similar, although there was one estimate I was 7 minutes off for. However, my estimate of 60 minutes for the
Project Management exercise in Prac 7 was completely wrong, as it took me almost 3 hours. After this, I over-estimated
how long the Prac 8 tasks would take, leading to the estimates being almost double the actual time it took. For Prac 9
though, my estimate for the Taxi Simulator exercise was pretty spot on. Overall, I don't think my accuracy really
improved over the full subject period, but it definitely improved from Pracs 7-8 to 9.

## Code Reviews

Of the five code reviews so far, only two people actually responded to the request. I didn't get much feedback from them
either, pretty much just to remember to add docstrings. On the other hand, through performing code reviews I noticed
just how many ways there are to do these tasks in Python, as typically the solution I reviewed was pretty different to
mine. I also feel like I understand SRP a lot more clearly now that I've reviewed code.

## Practical Tasks

I think the practical tasks are great and tested my knowledge of the subject in a challenging, but forgiving way. I
would probably make the Prac 7 Project Management exercise shorter if I were in charge.
