# Practical 7 - Classes 2

## Feedback Branch

This repository branch contains my submission for CP1404 Practical 7.

I'm an external student looking to improve my programming knowledge.

## Three things I have learned from CP1404:

- PEP8 naming conventions

- The importance of docstrings

- Don't repeat yourself
